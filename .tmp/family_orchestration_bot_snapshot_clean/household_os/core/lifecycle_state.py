"""
Canonical Lifecycle State Model

This is the SINGLE source of truth for all action lifecycle states.
All state derivation, comparison, and persistence use only these values.


This enum replaces:
 - Legacy FSM state names ("executed", "ignored")
 - Legacy string literals throughout the codebase

Migration path:
 - OLD: state == "executed"
 - NEW: state == LifecycleState.COMMITTED

Enum values are strings for backward compatibility with serialization.
