"""
Lifecycle Migration Layer - Dual-Write Mode

During migration from mutation-based FSM to event-sourced architecture:
- FSM continues to run and mutate state (for backward compatibility)
- Events are also generated and stored (new system)
- System asserts FSM state == event-derived state
- Detects divergence immediately (safety guarantee)

This layer ensures:
1. No data loss during migration
2. Both systems stay synchronized
3. Divergence is caught and reported
4. Can roll back to FSM-only if needed
